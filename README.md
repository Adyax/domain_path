Domain path
===========

The Domain Path module allows the creation of separate path aliases per domain 
for entities created using the Domain Access module. For example, it looks like:
https://d.pr/free/i/O4Vr9z on node edit form. The path aliases per domain are 
implemented as separate "domain_path" content entities. It is possible to create,
edit or delete path alias per domain manually here - "admin/config/domain_path" 
(https://d.pr/free/i/8KbeOU).

The module is ready for testing, but requires Domain Access to work correctly.
